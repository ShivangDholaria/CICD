# Introduction

In this repo, i will be writing step-by-step guide on implement CICD pipelins using DevOps and DevSecOps Principles. The pipelines would be either in AWS, AZURE or for local test. This is being made while keeping the cost to be either very minimal or 0. But make sure to delete the resources when following in the cloud. I wont be responsible if you incur charges for using the cloud resources. 

I wil try to write guides for local testing too.
